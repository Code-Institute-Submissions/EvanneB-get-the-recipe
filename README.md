# Get the Recipe

Get the Recipe is a website aimed at providing easy access to thousands of recipes to suit every users needs. I will also use this site as a space to keep my favouite recipes and provide inspiration for users. 
The website will take a user centric approach with a clear and easily navigated design. 
 
## UX

## The Strategy Plane
This website aims to;
- provide recipes for users looking to bake or cook someting specific with the use of the search function
- inspire users by hosting some recipes on the site
- increase social media presence 

## The Scope Plane
Users will be able to achieve the above goals through the use of the following;
- The edamam API function which allows us to search thousands of recipes as well as giving nutritional value and details on each..
- The recipes page will feature a range of different recipes to inspire users.
- The contact form will allow users to get in contact with me regarding any questions/ feedback they have.
- The social media links at the bottom of the page allow users to contact us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Pinterest.

## The Structure Plane
The webiste will consist of three pages, a home page, recipes page and contact page.
The navigation bar at the top of the page will allow the user to switch between the pages. 
The social media links at the bottom of each page will take the user directly to the respective media pages.
The contact form allows the user to send messages directly to myslef.

## The Skeletal Plane

## The Surface Place
The website will host a range of images of food to tempt uses and encourage them to bake. The recipes will display an image with a brief description of the recipe including ingredients used and calories and there will be a 'see recipe' button below when if clicked will take the user directly to the recipe.
The background will be a light blue colur as it is a colour which represent peace and calm. I find this suits thereputic act of baking very well. 
I will use cursive text as it gives a more personal feel to the page. The text colour will be grey in contrast to the light coloured background.
When a search is carried out, the recipies will appear with an image and brief description. The full recipe will not be displayed until the user clicks 'see recipe' at which point the recipe will open in a new tab. This is to ensure there is no clutter on the page.


## Features
 
### Existing Features
- Navbar - allows users to easily naviagte between the three pages, Home, Recipes and Contact.
- Search function - allows users to find recipes specific to their needs or they can even find recipes by searching the ingredients they have available. Examples of searches "low-fat muffins", "gluten-free brownies", "apples, flour, sugar". 
- Contact form - allows users to submit comments, questions directly to my mailbox by filling in the contact form. 
- Recipe preview - users can view pictures of the recipes and have the option of viewing the whole recipe when the click the 'see recipe' button.  

### Features Left to Implement
In future I would like to include:
- a profile section where users can save there favourite recipes and basically create their very own online cookbook.
- a healthy eating section where users can learn more about different foods and their benefits.

## Testing

1. Navbar:
    1. Go to 'home" page 
    2. Try to access "recipe" page via home page.
    3. Go back to "home" page and try access "contact" page
    4. Go to "recipe" page.
    5. Try to access "home" page from "recipe" page
    6. Return to "recipe" page and try to access "contact" page
    7. Go to "contact" page
    8. Try to access "home" page from "contact" page

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

- I started creating this website in a local git. I used 'git init' to create a new repository.
- At various stages I used 'git add .' to add changes to the repository.
- I used 'git commit -m "..."' to commit these changes with a message identifying what has been changed.
- I used 'git push' to push up the local git repository.
