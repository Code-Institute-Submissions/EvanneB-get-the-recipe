# Get the Recipe

Get the Recipe is a website aimed at providing easy access to recipes to suit your specific needs. I have also used this site as a space to keep my favouite recipes and provide inspiration for users. 
Our search algorithm returns the most relevant recipes from the most popular and best recipes sources on the web. We order recipes by their cookability and quality so your customer can always count on getting the best recipes!
 
## UX

## The Strategy Plane
This website aims to;
- provide recipes for users looking to bake or cook someting specific with the use of the search function
- inspire users by hosting some recipes on the site
- increase exposure for my home-baking enterprise by providing a contact form and locations where my baked goods are sold
- increase social media presence

## The Scope Plane
Users will be able to achieve the above goals through the use of the following;
- The edamam API function which allows us to search thousands of recipes.
- The recipes page will feature a range of different recipes to inspire users.
- The maps API function will show users where they can buy my baked goods.
- The contact form will allow users to get in contact with me regarding any questions/ feedback they have.
- The social media links at the bottom of the page allow users to contact us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Pinterest.

## The Structure Plane
The webiste will consist of three pages, a home page, recipes page and contact page.
The navigation bar at the top of the page will allow the user to switch between the pages. 

## The Skeletal Plane
## The Surface Place
The website will host a range of images of food to tempt uses and encourage them to bake. The recipes will display an image with a brief description of the recipe and a 'read more' button below were users can access the recipe.
The background will be a light blue colur as it is a colour which represent peace and calm. I find this suits thereputic act of baking. 
I will use cursive text as it gives a more personal feel to the page. The text colour will be grey in contrast to the light coloured background.






## Features
 
### Existing Features
- Navbar - allows users to easily naviagte between the three pages, Home, Recipes and Contact.
- Search function - allows users to find recipes specific to their needs or they can even find recipes by searching the ingredients they have available. Examples of searches "low-fat muffins", "gluten-free brownies", "apples, flour, sugar".
- Map function - this shows the user the marked locations where I sell some of my baked goods. The 
- Contact form - allows users to submit comments, questions directly to my mailbox by filling in the contact form. 
- Recipe preview - users can view pictures of the recipes and have the option of viewing the whole recipe when the click the 'read more' button. 
- Carousel of testimmonials - the carousel 

### Features Left to Implement
In future I would like to include:
- a profile section where users can save there favourite recipes and basically create their very own online cookbook.
- a healthy eating section where users can learn more about different foods and their benefits.

    - **CSS** is used to style the project.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
